# Czech Cybersecurity MCP

<!-- ANSVAR-CTA-BEGIN -->
> ### ▶ Try this MCP instantly via Ansvar Gateway
> **50 free queries/day · no card required · OAuth signup at [ansvar.eu/gateway](https://ansvar.eu/gateway)**
>
> One endpoint, one OAuth signup, access from any MCP-compatible client.

### Connect

**Claude Code** (one line):

```bash
claude mcp add ansvar --transport http https://gateway.ansvar.eu/mcp
```

**Claude Desktop / Cursor** — add to `claude_desktop_config.json` (or `mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ansvar": {
      "type": "url",
      "url": "https://gateway.ansvar.eu/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

**Claude.ai** — Settings → Connectors → Add custom connector → paste `https://gateway.ansvar.eu/mcp`

First request opens an OAuth flow at [ansvar.eu/gateway](https://ansvar.eu/gateway). After signup, your client is bound to your account; tier (free / premium / team / company) determines fan-out, quota, and which downstream MCPs are reachable.

## Self-host this MCP

You can also clone this repo and build the corpus yourself. The schema,
fetcher, and tool implementations all live here. What is not in the repo is
the pre-built database — TDM and standards-licensing constraints on the
upstream sources mean we host the corpus on Ansvar infrastructure rather
than redistribute it as a public artifact.

Build your own: run this repo's ingestion script (entry-point varies per
repo — typically `scripts/ingest.sh`, `npm run ingest`, or `make ingest`;
check the repo root).

## Data Sources and Freshness

All content is sourced from official Czech regulatory publications:

- **NUKIB (National Cyber and Information Security Agency)** -- Official regulatory authority

### Data Currency

- Database updates are periodic and may lag official publications
- Freshness checks run via GitHub Actions workflows
- Last-updated timestamps in tool responses indicate data age

See [COVERAGE.md](COVERAGE.md) and [data/coverage.json](data/coverage.json) for full provenance metadata.
